|       | Rect |

A **Rect** represents a 2-dimensional rectangle. It consists of a
starting x and y coordinate, and a width and length. Most, if not all,
components will have these as proportions of the total bounds, between 0
and 1. For example, for the
[SpriteProvider](SpriteProvider_(Component) "wikilink") component, the
Rect property bounds the sprite to be rendered, with the values being
proportions of the total width and height of the sprite image.

For dynamic variables and other components requiring a type, the type
for Rect is `BaseX.Rect`.
