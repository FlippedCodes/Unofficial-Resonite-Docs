String is a type which holds a text in UTF-16.

Note: If you are willing to handle "special characters" which requires
["surrogate
pairs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters#Surrogates)
to express it in UTF-16, you may want to use
[String_To_UTF32_(Protoflux_node)](String_To_UTF32_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink").
