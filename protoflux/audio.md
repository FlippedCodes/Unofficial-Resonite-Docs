The **Play One Shot** node plays the input `Clip` once when an impulse is received at `Play`. The manner in which the clip is played is highly configurable.

### Usage

#### Inputs

The `Clip` input determines which clip will be played. The easiest method to specify this is to use an [Audio Clip Input](Audio_Clip_Input_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") node.

The `Volume` controls the base volume with which the clip is played. Default is 1, i.e. full volume.

The `Speed` controls the speed with which the clip is played. Default is 1, i.e. standard playback speed.

The `Spatialize` input determines whether the audio source is spatialized within the world (i.e it sounds like it originates from a specific point) or non-spatialized. Note that this value can be overridden if the `SpatialBlend` is specified. Default is True.

The `SpatialBlend` input can be used to set an intermediate spatialization value. A value of 0 results in completely non-spatialized playback, a value of 1 results in fully spatialized playback, and values between these extremes result in the playback being partially spatialized. Note that this value, if specified, will override any `Spatialize` input. Default is 1.

The `Point` sets the origin point from which any spatialized audio will originate. This is interpreted as \[X;Y;Z\] coordinates in the [local coordinate space](Coordinate_spaces#Global_vs._Local "wikilink") of the `Root` input slot. Default is \[0;0;0\].

The `Root` input sets the slot relative to whose [local coordinate space](Coordinate_spaces#Global_vs._Local "wikilink") the `Point` value is interpreted. Default is the Play One Shot node's slot.

The `Priority` input sets the priority level of the spawned audio output. In the event too many audio outputs are present in a world, this is used to select which outputs are silenced. Higher priority outputs (i.e. priority number is **lower**) take precedence over ones with lower priority. Default is 128 (medium priority, lowest possible value is 256).

The `Doppler` input determines the strength of the simulated Doppler effect. Default is 1 (i.e. Doppler effect is applied), set this to 0 to disable.

The `MinDistance` input determines the distance (in metres) from the sound source at which volume rolloff begins. This only takes effect if the `Rolloff` value is Linear. Note that this input value is scaled depending on the `DistanceSpace` input - if that is set to Global then the MinDistance value is interpreted in global coordinate space, if set to Local it is interpeted in local coordinate space which may then be affected by the scale of the audio output. Default is 1.

The `MaxDistance` input determines the distance (in metres) from the sound source at which volume rolloff ends and the sound becomes inaudible. This only takes effect if the `Rolloff` value is Linear. Note that this input value is scaled depending on the `DistanceSpace` input - if that is set to Global then the MinDistance value is interpreted in global coordinate space, if set to Local it is interpeted in local coordinate space which may then be affected by the scale of the audio output. Default is 500.

The `Rolloff` input determines the volume rolloff mode used for the audio output. This must be set to Linear for `MinDistance` and `MaxDistance` to take effect. Default is Logarithmic.

The `Group` input determines what volume group the played audio is categorized under. Default is Sound Effects.

The `DistanceSpace` input determines whether scale and distance values are interpreted relative to global coordinates or local coordinates. Default is Global.

The `MinScale` input determines the MinScale field value on the spawned AudioOutput.

The `MaxScale` input determines the MaxScale field value on the spawned AudioOutput.

The `ParentUnderRoot` input determines whether the spawned "OneShotAudio" slot is parented directly under the input `Root` slot. If set to False, the "OneShotAudio" slot will be parented under the world root slot. Default is True.

The `LocalOnly` input determines whether the played audio will only be audible for the local user who owns the impulse arriving at `Play`. Default is False.

#### Outputs

The `OnStartedPlaying` output fires an impulse when the one shot audio has started playing as a result of an impulse at `Play`. This fires as long as a valid `Clip` input is present and continues the impulse chain which arrived at `Play`.

#### Notes

When an impulse is received at `Run`, and a valid `Clip` is available, a new non-persistent slot is spawned called "OneShotAudio" with [AudioOutput](AudioOutput_(Component) "wikilink"), [AudioClipPlayer](AudioClipPlayer_(Component) "wikilink"), and [StoppedPlayableCleaner](StoppedPlayableCleaner_(Component) "wikilink") components. This slot is automatically deleted when playback ends.

Play One Shot is an excellent playback option for audio which should play to completion after some trigger. This is because it prevents cluttering the limited audio buffer unless the relevant sound effect is actually playing. Play One Shot may not be ideal for situations where triggers occur extremely rapidly (e.g. in the case of an automatic weapon) due to the network traffic required to spawn and delete slots and components. In situations like those, consider using a persistent AudioOutput and AudioClipPlayer and using nodes under [:Category:Protoflux:Playback](:Category:Protoflux:Playback "wikilink") instead.
