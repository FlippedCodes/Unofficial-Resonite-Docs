## Patreon only

- `/addExitMessage <message>` - Submits an exit message
- `/listExitMessages` - Lists your submitted exit messages
- `/shareStorageWithGroup <group> <amount>` or `/shareStorageWithUser <user> <amount>` - Shares the specified amount of storage with a user or group (requires Patreon tier Builder (73€/month) or more)
- `/set2DBadge <resdb:/// URL>` or `/set3DBadge <record URL>` - Sets your 3D or 2D badge (3D badge limitations are 128 triangles, 256 verts); custom badges have some limitations:
  - 3D badges must be one mesh renderer, one static mesh (up to 128 triangles **or** 256 vertices) and a single texture (auto resized to 128px)
  - Only the following components are allowed on the badge:
    - `StaticTexture2D`
    - `StaticMesh`
    - `StaticShader`
    - `MeshRenderer`
    - `Spinner`
    - `Wiggler`
    - `Panner1D` -> `Panner4D`
    - Materials
- `/clear2DBadge` or `/clear3DBadge` - Removes your set 3D or 2D badge
- `/requestDeleteRecovery <time period> <name search>` - Starts the recovery of a deleted record matching a certain name under a certain time period
- `/headlessCode` - Displays the headless access code (requires Patreon Discoverer (10€/month) or more)

## Group Commands

Groups allow you to share an inventory space with a multitude of users, which can be useful to cooperate on projects.  
Creating a group is available starting at the Trailblazer Patreon tier (20€/month). Some other pledges can allow you to create more groups, for instance, Builder (73€/month) will allow you to create two groups and Crafter (145€/month) three groups.

Groups created on Resonite start without any storage and you will need to use `/shareStorageWithGroup` to allocate some to it.`

- `/createGroup <groupname>` - Create a new group with the specified group name
- `/getGroupInfo <groupname>` - Gets all the info about a group (requires you to be the admin of said group)
- `/addMember <groupname> <username> <quota>` - Adds a player to a group
  - Note: the quota is how many GBs a particular user can access of the full storage of the group. Setting it to `-1` means the member can use as much storage as they want. Groups come with no storage by default, you will need to allocate some with `/shareStorageWithGroup``.
- `/removeMember <groupname> <username>` - Removes a player from a group
- `/setMemberQuota <group> <user> <quota>` - Sets a user's quota
- `/getGroupSpace <group>` - Get how much storage is a group using
